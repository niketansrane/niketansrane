# Hi, I'm Niketan 👋

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, building AI-powered developer productivity tools that help developers ship their products and features faster. My resume is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hemqPU0I-QK_bORctt4F4RR-npnS_ZOESSLOH08g0F0).
If you want to talk Developer Experience, AI for developer productivity or cricket, I'm always up for a good chat.

🚀 **What I Do**
- Helped build the [Microsoft Developer Agent](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/build-like-microsoft-developer-agents-in-action/) — an AI system in Microsoft Teams that automates the entire PR lifecycle for Azure DevOps repositories. Featured at Microsoft Build 2025.
- Designed an [ML-based reviewer assignment system](https://www.niketansrane.com/blogs/teaching-machines-find-right-reviewers/) that serves 5,000+ developers and 20K+ pull requests across 1,000+ reviewer teams, using historical patterns, expertise, and geographic load balancing.
- Built [Shanashma](https://github.com/niketansrane/shanashma) — a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Its first plugin, ado-flow, brings Azure DevOps workflows (work items, PRs, pipelines) into your terminal.


💻 **Tech Stack**
- Python, C#, Django, FastAPI
- Azure (Cosmos DB, OpenAI, Active Directory)
- OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect
