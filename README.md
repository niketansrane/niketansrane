# Hi, I'm Niketan 👋

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, building AI-powered developer productivity tools that help developers ship their products and features faster.
If you want to talk Developer Experience, AI for developer productivity or cricket, I'm always up for a good chat.

🚀 **What I Do**
- Built the [Microsoft Developer Agent](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/build-like-microsoft-developer-agents-in-action/). It's a conversational AI system powered by LLMs that automates the entire pull request lifecycle (primarily Azure Devops repos).
- Designed ML-based reviewer assignment systems that process 300+ daily PRs across 250+ global reviewer teams for our monorepo.
- Created event-driven notification systems and analytics platforms that reduced false alarms by 70% for our CI-CD workflows.

💻 **Tech Stack**
- Python, C#, Django, FastAPI
- Azure (Cosmos DB, OpenAI, Active Directory)
- OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect
- Machine Learning (traditional ML + LLMs)
- Event-driven architectures

📝 **Recent Writing**

### About This Repo

This repository is my personal website—a minimalist, Ubuntu-inspired blog where I write about developer productivity, authentication systems, machine learning, and building tools that make engineers' lives easier.

Built with vanilla HTML/CSS as a learning exercise. I used copilot to build this end-to-end.
