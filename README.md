Hi! I'm Niketan Rane, a senior software engineer at Microsoft. I mostly work on AI-powered developer tools and ML systems that help engineers ship faster.

I helped build the [Microsoft Developer Agent](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/build-like-microsoft-developer-agents-in-action/) — an AI system that automates PR workflows in Teams — which was featured at Microsoft Build 2025. Before that, I designed an ML-based reviewer assignment system that handles 300+ PRs a day across 250+ reviewer teams. More recently, I've been building [Shanashma](https://github.com/niketansrane/shanashma), a Claude Code plugin that brings Azure DevOps into your terminal.

I write about what I learn: [building AI agents](https://www.niketansrane.com/blogs/claude-agent-continuous-codebase-improvement/), [ML for code review](https://www.niketansrane.com/blogs/teaching-machines-find-right-reviewers/), [authentication systems](https://www.niketansrane.com/blogs/understanding-authentication-oauth/), and [developer tools](https://www.niketansrane.com/blogs/shanashma-claude-code-plugin-azure-devops/).
