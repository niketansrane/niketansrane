# Hi, I'm Niketan 👋

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, building AI-powered developer productivity tools that help thousands of developers ship faster. I love solving real workflow problems at scale—the kind where manual processes eat up hours and people drown in notifications they don't need.

🚀 **What I Do**
- Built the [Microsoft Developer Agent](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/build-like-microsoft-developer-agents-in-action/)—a conversational AI system powered by GPT-4 that automates the entire pull request lifecycle
- Designed ML-based reviewer assignment systems that process 300+ daily PRs across 250+ global teams
- Created event-driven notification systems and analytics platforms that reduced false alarms by 70%

💻 **Tech Stack**
- Python, C#, Django, FastAPI
- Azure (Cosmos DB, OpenAI, Active Directory)
- OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect
- Machine Learning (traditional ML + LLMs)
- Event-driven architectures

📝 **Recent Writing**
- [Teaching Machines to Find the Right Reviewer](https://niketansrane.com/blogs/teaching-machines-to-find-the-right-reviewer.html) - Building ML-powered code review systems
- [Understanding Authentication: OpenID Connect](https://niketansrane.com/blogs/understanding-authentication-openid.html) - Delegated authentication deep dive

### About This Repo

This repository is my personal website—a minimalist, Ubuntu-inspired blog where I write about developer productivity, authentication systems, machine learning, and building tools that make engineers' lives easier.

**Live at**: [niketansrane.com](https://niketansrane.com) (custom domain via GitHub Pages)

Built with vanilla HTML/CSS as a learning exercise. No frameworks, no build process—just clean, semantic markup and thoughtful design.

If you want to talk DevEx, system design, AI for developer workflows, cricket, or just about food and travel—I'm always up for a good chat.
